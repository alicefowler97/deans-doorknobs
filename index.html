  <h3>Coding Class &#9732;</h3>
  <p>My first coding class exceeded my expectations. I love that there are so many different
  combinations <br> that allow you to create a unique website. My teacher is great, so committed to
my learning and clearly <br> passionate about his craft. I look forward to all the things I will
learn and in time having the skills to create my own websites! #codingislyfe</p>
<p>A website that I particularly enjoy browsing both for its content and layout is
  <a href="http://www.oystermag.com">Oyster Magazine!</a> </p>

<p> Here is a blissful dog. <p> <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HEjoNp_qRz8/TTfYi5GmjqI/AAAAAAAAKwg/ErwJUTThAu4/s1600/Daily+Funny+Animals+Picdump+%252810%2529.jpg">
